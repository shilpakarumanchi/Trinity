# Trinity Health Insurance - Marketing Insights

The goal of this project is to investigate the performance of marketing campaigns at Trinity Insurance in order to surface recommendations on marketing budget allocation across future campaign categories.
Trinity Insurance is a medical insurance company founded in 2016, serving over thousands of customers throughout the United States. In 2019, Trinity launched a new set of marketing campaign categories spanning topics like wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. Customers can sign up for 4 different plans - bronze, silver, gold, and platinum - each with different premiums and claim coverage rates.

The company would like to build more understanding of the effectiveness of these campaign categories and how they relate to signups and subsequent patient claims. The budget is allocated to drive two primary objectives: 
  1) to increase the number of customer signups, and
  2) to raise awareness of Row Healthâ€™s brand across the country.
